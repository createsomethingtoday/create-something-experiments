> **End Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## THE EXPERIMENT

### Problem
[Describe the specific problem or challenge you're addressing]

### Hypothesis
I hypothesized that [specific prediction about AI-native development approach and expected outcome].

**Note:** Tracking started mid-project, so some metrics are reconstructed from git history and memory.

### Why This Matters
[Explain the significance despite mid-flight start]

## WHAT I MEASURED

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific measurable criterion 3]

### Metrics Tracked

**Before Tracking (Estimated):**
- **Time:** Approximately [X] hours (git commit timestamps)
- **Errors:** Estimated [X] (from git history)
- **Interventions:** Recalled from memory

**After Tracking (Precise):**
- **Time:** [X] hours (real-time session tracking)
- **Costs:** $[X.XX] tokens + $[X.XX] infrastructure (APIs)
- **Errors:** [X] documented with resolution times
- **Interventions:** [X] manual fixes logged

### Data Sources
- **Pre-tracking:** Git commit history, memory, Cloudflare Analytics
- **Post-tracking:** Claude Code Analytics API, hooks, real-time logs

## THE BUILD PROCESS

### Timeline

**Phase 1: Pre-Tracking ([X]% complete)**
- Estimated [X] hours based on git commits
- [X] commits between [date] and [tracking start date]
- Main features: [list what was built before tracking]

**Phase 2: Post-Tracking ([X]% complete)**
- Tracked [X] hours precisely
- [X] Claude Code iterations
- Completed: [list what was built with tracking]

### Costs

**Estimated Pre-Tracking:**
- AI Tokens: ~$[X.XX] (estimated)
- Infrastructure: $[X.XX] (Cloudflare billing for period)

**Tracked Post-Tracking:**
- AI Tokens: $[X.XX] (Claude Code Analytics API)
- Infrastructure: $[X.XX] (Cloudflare billing)

**Total:** ~$[X.XX] (some uncertainty in pre-tracking phase)

### Performance
- **Iteration Count:** [X] (post-tracking only)
- **Build Time:** [X] minutes
- **Response Time:** [X]ms (production)
- **Uptime:** [XX.X]% (since deployment)

## WHAT CLAUDE DID WELL

### [Capability 1] (Post-Tracking)
Claude excelled at [specific task]:

```[language]
// Example from tracked phase
[code snippet]
```

**Result:** [Specific outcome]

### [Capability 2] (Pre-Tracking, Reconstructed)
Based on git history, Claude likely performed well at [task]:
- Evidence: [git commits showing this]
- Outcome: [what was accomplished]

### [Capability 3]
[Another strength observed]

---

## WHERE I INTERVENED

**Pre-Tracking (Reconstructed):**
- Approximately [X] interventions based on git commit patterns
- Cannot provide precise error counts or resolution times
- Major issues recalled: [list significant problems from memory]

**Post-Tracking (Precise):**

### Issue #1: [Problem Name]
**Iteration:** [X]
**Error:** [Description]
**Resolution:** [Fix applied]
**Time:** [X] minutes
**Learning:** [Insight]

### Issue #2: [Problem Name]
[Same structure]

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What This Proves
- ✅ [Specific validated claim from tracked phase]
- ✅ [Another claim with confidence level]
- ⚠️ [Claim with acknowledged limitation from pre-tracking phase]

### What This Doesn't Prove
- ❌ [Limitation due to mid-flight start]
- ❌ [Another limitation]
- ❌ [Third limitation]

### Confidence Level
**Mixed** - Precise metrics for post-tracking phase ([X]% of work), estimated metrics for pre-tracking phase ([X]% of work). Git history and production data provide partial validation.

### Data Quality Breakdown
- **High confidence:** Final [X]% of development (real-time tracking)
- **Medium confidence:** Initial [X]% (git history + memory + production data)
- **Low confidence:** Exact error counts and intervention times from pre-tracking phase

## CLOUDFLARE ARCHITECTURE

### Services Used
- **Cloudflare Workers:** [Purpose]
- **D1 Database:** [Schema]
- **[Other Services]:** [Use cases]

### Architectural Decisions
1. **[Decision 1]:** [Reasoning]
2. **[Decision 2]:** [Alternative considered]
3. **[Decision 3]:** [Outcome]

**Note:** Some architectural decisions were made before tracking began. Documented based on git history and code review.

### Production Outcomes
- **Deployment Time:** [X] minutes
- **Monthly Cost:** $[X.XX] (validated from Cloudflare billing)
- **Performance:** [Real metrics from production]

## REPRODUCIBILITY

### Starting Prompt (Reconstructed)
```
[Best effort reconstruction of initial prompt based on earliest commits]
```

**Note:** Actual starting prompt not logged. This is reconstructed from git history.

### Tracking Logs
Post-tracking data available in `.claude/experiments/[experiment-name]/`:
- `log.md` - Session notes from tracking start
- `prompts.jsonl` - Prompts from tracked phase only
- `metrics.jsonl` - Timing, cost data (partial)
- `errors.log` - Errors from tracked phase
- `interventions.log` - Manual interventions (tracked phase)

**Pre-tracking work:** Git commit history available for review

## CONCLUSION

**Key Takeaway:** [One sentence summarizing the main learning]

**Limitation Acknowledgment:** Mid-flight tracking means approximately [X]% of the development process wasn't captured with real-time precision. Future experiments will use real-time tracking from start.

**Next Experiment:** [Hypothesis for follow-up with real-time tracking]

**Data Transparency:**
- **Tracked:** Final [X]% with real-time logging
- **Estimated:** Initial [X]% from git history and memory
- Acknowledged limitations in precision for pre-tracking phase
- Production data validates core claims
