## THE BUILD PROCESS

### Timeline (Reconstructed)
**Note:** Precise session times not tracked. Estimates from git commits.

- **Initial Setup:** ~[X] hours (estimated)
- **Core Development:** ~[X] hours (commit frequency analysis)
- **Debugging:** ~[X] hours (large gaps between commits suggest debugging)
- **Deployment:** ~[X] hours (deployment-related commits)

**Total Estimated Time:** ~[X] hours

### Costs (Partially Validated)
- **AI Tokens:** ~$[X.XX] (estimated - no tracking data available)
- **Cloudflare Infrastructure:** $[X.XX]/month (validated from billing)
- **Total Development Cost:** ~$[X.XX] (high uncertainty on token costs)

**Confidence:** LOW on development costs, HIGH on production infrastructure costs

### Performance (Validated)
- **Uptime:** [XX.X]% ([X] months of production data)
- **Avg Response Time:** [X]ms (Cloudflare Analytics)
- **Peak Traffic:** [X] requests/minute
- **Data Stored:** [X]MB in D1

## WHAT CLAUDE DID WELL (Reconstructed)

### [Capability 1]
Based on git commits and deployed code, Claude likely excelled at [task]:

```[language]
// Example from deployed codebase
[code snippet]
```

**Evidence:** [Git commits or production behavior supporting this]

### [Capability 2]
Production system shows [pattern] which suggests Claude handled [task] effectively.

**Validation:** [Production data or code quality metrics]

### [Capability 3]
[Third reconstructed strength based on outcomes]

---

## WHERE I INTERVENED (Best Effort Recall)

**Note:** Precise error counts, iteration numbers, and resolution times were not tracked.

### Issue #1: [Recalled Problem]
**Evidence:** [Git commit message, code comments, or production behavior]
**Likely Resolution:** [Based on code review]
**Impact:** [Observable outcome]

### Issue #2: [Recalled Problem]
[Same structure]

### General Observation
The git history shows [X] major refactoring commits, suggesting [X] significant interventions were required.

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What This Proves
- ✅ **Production viability:** System has [XX.X]% uptime over [X] months
- ✅ **Cost effectiveness:** $[X.XX]/month validated infrastructure cost
- ✅ **Performance:** [X]ms response time validated
- ⚠️ **Development efficiency:** Cannot prove precise time savings (no baseline)

### What This Doesn't Prove
- ❌ **Precise development time:** Estimates only, no session tracking
- ❌ **Iteration efficiency:** No prompt logs available
- ❌ **Error recovery time:** Cannot validate debugging speed
- ❌ **AI token costs:** Estimates only, no API tracking
- ❌ **Exact intervention count:** Based on memory and git analysis

### Confidence Level
**LOW** for development process, **HIGH** for production outcomes.

This retroactive documentation provides validated production data but cannot make precise claims about the development process itself. Use with caution for comparative analysis.

## CLOUDFLARE ARCHITECTURE

### Services Used (Validated)
- **Cloudflare Workers:** [Validated by production deployment]
- **D1 Database:** [Schema documented, X records]
- **KV Storage:** [X entries, validated]
- **[Other Services]:** [Validated by billing]

### Architectural Decisions (Reconstructed)
1. **[Decision 1]:** Chosen based on [production behavior and code structure]
2. **[Decision 2]:** Evident from [specific implementation details]
3. **[Decision 3]:** Validated by [production performance]

### Production Outcomes (Validated)
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare global network
- **Edge Locations:** 300+ automatically
- **Monthly Cost:** $[X.XX] (validated from billing)
- **Uptime:** [XX.X]% ([X] months validated)

## CONCLUSION

**Key Takeaway:** [One sentence on what the deployed system proves about AI-native development]

**Limitation Acknowledgment:** This is retroactive documentation. While production outcomes are validated, the development process metrics are estimates with acknowledged low confidence. Future experiments will use real-time tracking.

**Value Despite Limitations:** Production data over [X] months provides validated evidence of [specific claim about system viability/performance/cost].

**Next Experiment:** [Hypothesis for a properly tracked experiment based on these learnings]

---

**Data Transparency:**
- **High confidence:** Production performance, uptime, infrastructure costs
- **Medium confidence:** Development timeline from git commits
- **Low confidence:** Iteration counts, error resolution times, AI token costs
- **Unavailable:** Real-time logs, precise session metrics, original prompts

**Honest Assessment:**
This retroactive documentation is still valuable for:
- Validating production viability of AI-built systems
- Demonstrating architectural patterns that work
- Providing cost data for deployed systems
- Sharing learnings despite imperfect data

**Tech Stack:**
- Claude Code (Sonnet 4+)
- Cloudflare [Services Used]
- [Other technologies]

**Generated with:** CREATE SOMETHING Experiments Methodology (Retroactive)
